# exercise-autolayout
From auto-layout tour (https://github.com/qilytquang/auto-layout)

See requirements of the exercise: http://blog.devslopes.com/p/d270c03e-f690-472b-8a14-163b605e9889/

### My addition requirements: (for applying size-classes)
* Add a label inside the top view
* Change text color of the label when change size of device from wC-hC to wR-hC
* Change text color and text fonts of the label when change size of device from wC-hC (or wR-hC) to wR-hR

> Get more informations about size-classes, wC-hC, wR-hC..., let go see [size-classes](https://github.com/qilytquang/size-classes) example

### What did I learn at this project:
* `Applying autolayout with contraints & size-classes`
